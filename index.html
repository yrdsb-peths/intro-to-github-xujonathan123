            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Young Sparks STEM was started by a group of high school students in 2025. The team focuses on designing, building, 
                and experimenting with projects that address real-world challenges, including environmental issues. Through hands-on 
                projects, problem-solving, and creative experimentation, Young Sparks STEM aims to develop practical engineering skills, 
                explore innovative ideas, and learn how to tackle complex problems collaboratively.
